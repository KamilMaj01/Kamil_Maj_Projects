In this repo i have uploaded several my mini projects which i created in diffrent programming languages. In each of project is located document .pdf with description.

Current project (Python) 
Lately, in my free time, I've been working on a project where I use the ModbusTCP protocol to read specific parameters from a Siemens LOGO 8 PLC controller, which controls an actuator. Utilizing the Flask framework, I display the parameters on an HTTP webpage and provide functionalities such as controlling the PLC controller and checking the history of errors that occurred during the device's operation.
