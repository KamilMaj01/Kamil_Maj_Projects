# Kamil_Maj_Projects
My name is Kamil Maj and i am studying at AGH university of science and technology. My field of study is Automatic control and robotic. In this repo i have uploaded several my mini projects which i created in diffrent programming languages. In each of project is located document .pdf with description.

Last project (Python, Flask, Simens PLC) 
The project used the ModbusTCP protocol to read specific parameters from the Simens LOGO PLC controller that controls the ski lift. Together with the Flask framework, a web application was created that displays the read parameters. It also allows you to control the PLC controller and check the history of errors that occurred during device operation.
